Fall Detection Using Human Pose Estimation
Detection Report

Overview:
This project implements an automated fall detection system using human pose estimation.
The system analyzes video streams frame by frame to identify fall events based on human body posture and movement patterns.

Methodology:
MediaPipe Pose is used to extract skeletal keypoints from each video frame, including shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles.
Fall detection is performed using a combination of:
1. Torso orientation (shoulder–hip angle)
2. Reduction in vertical body height (head-to-ankle distance)
3. Temporal consistency across consecutive frames

A fall is detected when the torso becomes near-horizontal and the vertical body height significantly reduces for multiple consecutive frames, indicating a lying posture.

Posture Classification:
- Standing: Torso is vertical with normal body height.
- Bent: Torso is partially inclined with moderate height reduction.
- Fall Detected (Lying): Torso is near-horizontal with compressed vertical height.

Detection Logic:
- Torso angle threshold: < 45 degrees
- Height reduction threshold: < 0.5 (normalized)
- Temporal confirmation: Fall condition sustained for at least 4 consecutive frames
- False positives are minimized by requiring posture stability over time.

Results:
The system successfully processed multiple input videos.
All detected fall events were logged into a single consolidated log file along with their respective timestamps and video names.

Example Log Format:
Fall detected at 00:00:42 in video1.mp4

Confidence and Reliability:
The fall detection approach demonstrates high reliability for identifying lying postures.
Estimated confidence level: 0.85 (High)
The temporal confirmation strategy reduces false positives caused by brief bending or sitting actions.

Limitations:
- Designed for single-person detection per frame
- Performance may vary with camera angle and video quality
- Does not distinguish intentional lying from accidental falls

Conclusion:
The implemented system effectively detects fall events using pose-based analysis.
It meets the requirements for accurate pose estimation, fall detection, video annotation, and event logging, making it suitable for real-world monitoring and academic evaluation.
